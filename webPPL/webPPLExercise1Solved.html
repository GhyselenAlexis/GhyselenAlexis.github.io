<h1> 1) Functional Programming </h1>

<h3> 1.1) Simple Example</h3>
<p>
Consider the following function of two numbers, written in WebPPL: 
<pre>
var g = function(a,b) {
  var f = function(a,b) {
    if (b > 0) {
      return (a + b)
    }
    else {
      return (a - b)
    }
  }
  return f(a,b)
}
</pre>

What does this function do ? Can you propose a program computing the same function, but in an easier way ? 
</p>

<p class = solution>
SOLUTION: This function adds a with the absolute value of b. Another way to write this would be to compute the absolute value directly, or use the 
Math library. 
</p>
<p>
<pre>
// If I want to redifine the abs function
var myAbs = function(x) {
  (x > 0) ? x : -x
}

var g = function(a,b) {
  return a + myAbs(b)
}

// Otherwise, we can just use the Math library if we know it exists. 
var g2 = function(a,b) {
  return a + Math.abs(b)
}

// Some tests
display([g(5,5),g(5,-5),g2(5,5),g2(5,-5)])
</pre>
</p>


<h3> 1.2) Newton's Method</h3>
<p> 
The Newton's Method (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">wikipedia</a>) is a well-known method to approximate a function. 
We will not detail how it works, but we will see a use on a well-known example: Estimating the square root of 2. 
</p>

<p> 
a) Show that the square root of 2 is a fixpoint of the function f(x) = (x / 2) + 1/x (ie, show that f(√2) = √2)
</p>

<p class = solution>
SOLUTION: We have to verify that (√2 / 2) + 1 / √2 = (2 * √2 / 2) = √2
</p>

<p> 
b) The Newton's Method says that, under some hypothesis, you can estimate a number r by iterating recursively a function f for which r is a fixpoint. 
Let us try this in webPPL. Write a higher-order program "applyN", that takes as an argument a number x, a function f, a number n, and compute f(f(f(f(f(...x...))))),
repeated n times. Verify your program by using defining function "incr" that increases its argument by 1, and applyN(x,incr,n) should be equal to x + n.  
</p>

<p class = solution>
  SOLUTION:
</p>

<pre>
var applyN = function(x,f,n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    // Applying f "0 time", means that we just return the initial element x
    return x
  }
  else {
    // Otherwise, we apply f once, giving us f(x)
    // And then, we apply f (n-1) times. 
    return applyN(f(x),f,n-1)
  }
}

var incr = function(x) {
  return x+1
}

applyN(5,incr,10) // Should be equal to 15. 
</pre>

<p>c) Copy/Paste the function applyN you defined above. And use it to iterate once, twice, 5 times and 100 times the function f(x) = (x / 2) + 1/x starting from 1. 
  Compare this result with the square root of 2. What can you deduce ? </p>

<p class = solution> SOLUTION:</p>
<pre>
display(Math.sqrt(2))

var applyN = function(x,f,n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return x
  }
  else {
    return applyN(f(x),f,n-1)
  }
}

// We define the function f 
var f = function(x) {return (x/2 + 1/x )}

// We apply it with n=1, n=2, n=5, n=100, starting from x=1, and we display. 
display(applyN(1,f,1))
display(applyN(1,f,2))
display(applyN(1,f,5))
display(applyN(1,f,100))
</pre>

<p class = solution> As we can see, we very quickly converge to the actual value of the square root of 2. This is very efficient. </p>

<p>d) In the general case, if you want to find the square root of R, you can use the function f(x) = (x / 2) + (R / 2x). Verify that this works with the 
  square root of 3. 
</p>

<p class = solution>
SOLUTION: Intuitively, this is because, (√R / 2) + (R / 2 * √R) = (2R / 2 * √R) = √R, so we have again a fixpoint.  
</p>

<pre>
display(Math.sqrt(3))

var applyN = function(x,f,n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return x
  }
  else {
    return applyN(f(x),f,n-1)
  }
}

// We define the function f 
var f = function(x) {return (x/2 + 3/(2 *x) )}

// We apply it with n=1, n=2, n=5, n=100, starting from x=1, and we display. 
display(applyN(1,f,1))
display(applyN(1,f,2))
display(applyN(1,f,5))
display(applyN(1,f,100))
</pre>

<h1> 2) Generative Models</h1>

<h3> 2.1) Simple Examples</h3>
<p>
a) Show mathematically that the marginal distribution on return values for these three programs is the same by directly computing the probability using the rules of probability 
(hint: write down each possible history of random choices for each program).

<pre>
flip() ? flip(0.6) : flip(0.2)
</pre>
<pre>
flip(flip() ? 0.6 : 0.2)
</pre>
<pre>
flip(.4)
</pre>
</p>

<p class = solution> 
SOLUTION: For the two first program, the choices are exactly the same: with probability 1/2, we do flip(0.6) and with probability 1/2, we do flip(0.2)
<br>
From this, we can obtain true with probability P(true) = 0.5 * 0.6 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.4
<br>
This is exactly the probablity of the last program.  
</p>

<p>
b) Check your answers by sampling from the programs, 1000 times each, and plotting the results.
</p>

<p class = solution>
SOLUTION : We just have to remember to define thunk function in order to repeat. 
</p>
<p>
<pre>
viz(repeat(1000,function() {flip() ? flip(0.6) : flip(0.2)}))
</pre>
<pre>
viz(repeat(1000,function() {flip(flip() ? 0.6 : 0.2)}))
</pre>
<pre>
viz(repeat(1000,function() {flip(.4)}))
</pre>
</p>

<h3> 2.2) Persistent Randomness </h3>
<p>
a) Explain why these two programs give different answers (i.e. have different distributions on return values).
<pre>
var foo = flip()
display([foo, foo, foo])
</pre>
<pre>
var foo = function() { return flip() }
display([foo(), foo(), foo()])
</pre>
</p>

<p class = solution>
SOLUTION: Those two programs give different answers because the first one repeat a data chosen randomly (true or false) three times, thus we can only obtain either 
[true,true,true] or [false, false, false]
<br>
The second program actually flip a coin for each element of the list, thus we can have all the 8 possibilities of combinations of true and false. 
</p>

<p>
b) Modify the second program using mem so that it has the same distribution as the first program.
</p>

<p class = solution>
SOLUTION: This is exactly the definition of memoization to duplicate the result. Thus we can do: 
</p>
<pre>
var foo = mem(function() { return flip() })
display([foo(), foo(), foo()])
</pre>

<p>
c) Change the program in question b so that the first two elements in the list are always the same as each other, but the third element can be different. 
Optional challenge: try to do this by adding only these 4 characters: x, 0, 0, and 1.
</p>
<p class = solution>
SOLUTION : We give an argument to the foo function. 
</p>
<pre>
var foo = mem(function(x) { return flip() })
display([foo(0), foo(0), foo(1)])
</pre>


<h3> 2.3) Medical Diagnosis</h3>
<p> In the simple medical diagnosis example, we imagined a generative process for diseases and symptoms of a single patient. 
In this exercise, we’ll write a version of that model that represents the diseases and symptoms of many patients.
</p>

<p> 
a) Let’s look at just two common conditions (a cold and allergies) and just two symptoms (sneeze and fever),
and let’s assume that symptoms are deterministic.
</p>

<pre>
var allergies = flip(0.3)
var cold = flip(0.2)

var sneeze = cold || allergies
var fever = cold

display([sneeze, fever])
</pre>
<p>Under this model, what is the probability that the patient is sneezing? 
What is the probability that the patient is sneezing and has a fever?
</p>

<p class = solution>
To compute the probability that a patient is sneezing, we look at the probability that the patient is not sneezing, ie that he does not have 
a cold nor an allergy. This probability is equal to 
<br>
P(not sneezing) = 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56
<br> 
Thus, the probability of sneezing is 0.44. To be both sneezing and having a fever, the patient need to have a cold. Thus the probability is 0.2.
</p>


<p> 
b) Inspect the joint probability distributions of sneeze and fever using Infer.
</p>
<pre>
var dist = Infer({method: "forward", samples: 1000}, function() {
  // We can just copy-paste the model above
  var allergies = flip(0.3)
  var cold = flip(0.2)

  var sneeze = cold || allergies
  var fever = cold
  // We return an object with two properties, called sneeze and fever. 
  return { sneeze, fever }
})

viz(dist) 

//The vizualisation is a bit bad automatically, thus we can use the table to have something more satisfactory. 
viz.table(dist) 
</pre>


<p>
c) If we wanted to represent the diseases of many patients we might have tried to make each disease and symptom into a function from a person 
to whether they have that disease, like this:
<pre>
var allergies = function(person) { return flip(.3) }
var cold = function(person) { return flip(.2) }

var sneeze = function(person) { return cold(person) || allergies(person) }

display([sneeze('bob'), sneeze('alice')])
</pre>
Add fever to the program above, and use Infer to inspect the probability distribution over Bob’s symptoms.
Is this the same probability distribution that you computed for the single patient in question a? 
If not, what can you do to fix this program to capture our intuitions correctly?
</p>

<p class = solution>
SOLUTION: If we add fever to the program above naively, and then infer on bob we obtain: 
</p>

<pre>
var model = function() {
  var allergies = function(person) { return flip(.3) }
  var cold = function(person) { return flip(.2) }

  var sneeze = function(person) { return cold(person) || allergies(person) }
  var fever = function(person) {return cold(person)}

  return [sneeze('bob'),fever('bob')]
}

var dist = Infer(model)

viz(dist)
viz.table(dist)
</pre>

<p class = solution>
  This is not the same probablity as before. In particular, Bob can have a fever without sneezing, which cas not possible before. 
  This is because the diseases of bob are not persistent in this model, thus the model may consider that bob have a cold when computing 
  the sneeze function, but that he may not have one when computing the fever function. In order to capture our intuition, we need to use mem
</p>
<pre>
var model = function() {
  var allergies = mem(function(person) { return flip(.3) })
  var cold = mem(function(person) { return flip(.2) })

  var sneeze = function(person) { return cold(person) || allergies(person) }
  var fever = function(person) {return cold(person)}

  return [sneeze('bob'),fever('bob')]
}

var dist = Infer(model)

viz(dist)
viz.table(dist)
</pre>
