Those exercises are mainly taken from <a href="https://probmods.org/exercises/generative-models.html">probmods</a> and Chapter 1 of <a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>. A second version of this page, with 
the answers, will be available on virtuale after we have done them in class.

<h1> 1) Functional Programming </h1>

<h3> 1.1) Simple Example</h3>
<p>
Consider the following function of two numbers, written in WebPPL: 
<pre>
var g = function(a,b) {
  var f = function(a,b) {
    if (b > 0) {
      return (a + b)
    }
    else {
      return (a - b)
    }
  }
  return f(a,b)
}
</pre>

What does this function do ? Can you propose a program computing the same function, but in an easier way ?

<h3> 1.2) Newton's Method</h3>
<p> 
The Newton's Method (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">wikipedia</a>) is a well-known method to approximate a function. 
We will not detail how it works, but we will see a use on a well-known example: Estimating the square root of 2. 
</p>

<p> 
a) Show that the square root of 2 is a fixpoint of the function f(x) = (x / 2) + 1/x (ie, show that f(√2) = √2)
</p>

<p> 
b) The Newton's Method says that, under some hypothesis, you can estimate a number r by iterating recursively a function f for which r is a fixpoint. 
Let us try this in webPPL. Write a higher-order program "applyN", that takes as an argument a number x, a function f, a number n, and compute f(f(f(f(f(...x...))))),
repeated n times. Verify your program by using defining function "incr" that increases its argument by 1, and applyN(x,incr,n) should be equal to x + n.  
</p>

<pre>
var applyN = function(x,f,n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return ...
  }
  else {
    return ...
  }
}

var incr = function(x) {
  return ... 
}

applyN(5,incr,10) // Should be equal to 15. 
</pre>

<p>c) Copy/Paste the function applyN you defined above. And use it to iterate once, twice, 5 times and 100 times the function f(x) = (x / 2) + 1/x starting from 1. 
  Compare this result with the square root of 2. What can you deduce ? </p>
<pre>
display(Math.sqrt(2))

... 
</pre>

<p>d) In the general case, if you want to find the square root of R, you can use the function f(x) = (x / 2) + (R / 2x). Verify that this works with the 
  square root of 3. 
</p>

<h1> 2) Generative Models</h1>

<h3> 2.1) Simple Examples</h3>
<p>
a) Show mathematically that the marginal distribution on return values for these three programs is the same by directly computing the probability using the rules of probability 
(hint: write down each possible history of random choices for each program).

<pre>
flip() ? flip(0.6) : flip(0.2)
</pre>
<pre>
flip(flip() ? 0.6 : 0.2)
</pre>
<pre>
flip(.4)
</pre>
</p>

<p>
b) Check your answers by sampling from the programs, 1000 times each, and plotting the results.
<pre>
...
</pre>
<pre>
...
</pre>
<pre>
...
</pre>
</p>

<h3> 2.2) Persistent Randomness </h3>
<p>
a) Explain why these two programs give different answers (i.e. have different distributions on return values).
<pre>
var foo = flip()
display([foo, foo, foo])
</pre>
<pre>
var foo = function() { return flip() }
display([foo(), foo(), foo()])
</pre>
</p>

<p>
b) Modify the second program using mem so that it has the same distribution as the first program.
<pre>
... 
</pre>
</p>

<p>
c) Change the program in question b so that the first two elements in the list are always the same as each other, but the third element can be different. 
Optional challenge: try to do this by adding only these 4 characters: x, 0, 0, and 1.

<h3> 2.3) Medical Diagnosis</h3>
<p> In the simple medical diagnosis example, we imagined a generative process for diseases and symptoms of a single patient. 
In this exercise, we’ll write a version of that model that represents the diseases and symptoms of many patients.
</p>

<p> 
a) Let’s look at just two common conditions (a cold and allergies) and just two symptoms (sneeze and fever),
and let’s assume that symptoms are deterministic.
</p>

<pre>
var allergies = flip(0.3)
var cold = flip(0.2)

var sneeze = cold || allergies
var fever = cold

display([sneeze, fever])
</pre>
Under this model, what is the probability that the patient is sneezing? 
What is the probability that the patient is sneezing and has a fever?

<p> 
b) Inspect the joint probability distributions of sneeze and fever using Infer.
<pre>
Infer({method: "forward", samples: 1000}, function() {
  ...
  return { ... }
})
</pre>
</p>

<p>
c) If we wanted to represent the diseases of many patients we might have tried to make each disease and symptom into a function from a person 
to whether they have that disease, like this:
<pre>
var allergies = function(person) { return flip(.3) }
var cold = function(person) { return flip(.2) }

var sneeze = function(person) { return cold(person) || allergies(person) }

display([sneeze('bob'), sneeze('alice')])
</pre>
Add fever to the program above, and use Infer to inspect the probability distribution over Bob’s symptoms.
Is this the same probability distribution that you computed for the single patient in question a? 
If not, what can you do to fix this program to capture our intuitions correctly?
</p>
